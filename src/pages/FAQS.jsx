      title: "How is SOSE Organic different from other organic Products",
      content:
        "SOSE Organic products come mainly comes from our Trusted & Ethical Farmers all over the Bharat. <br/><br/> We are an organic food, natural home care and handmade personal care brand from the house of Suryan Organic. We were born out of the need to start at the beginning, to go to the roots of our problems. As an enterprise that is inspired by the mission of Bansi Gir Gaushala, our aim is to contribute to the revival of “ Gau Sanskriti ”, an ancient culture which placed the Gaumata (Cow as the Divine Mother) at the center of all economic, cultural and social activity.  Agriculture is the foundation of such a culture, and it is with this paradigm that we seek to find solutions to the problems facing Bharat and humanity at large. <br/><br/> Our country and the world spend billions of dollars each year after synthetic fertilizer and pesticide subsidies. This introduces toxic chemicals in the food chain driving health imbalances and further spending on public health. We believe there is an urgent need to develop natural methods to improve farm production and distribution. <br/><br/> Our parent Suryan Organic has more than 10 years of organic farming, food research and development experience. We are associated with over 55,000 organic and naturally growing trusted farmers, from all over BHARAT. We believe that if we have to make a difference in society, our influence must extend from the farm all the way to the urban household.",

      title: "Difference between organic and conventional grown foods?",
      content:
        "High nitrogen application to plant foods can increase crude protein concentration but decrease the nutritional value of that protein. Conventional fertilizing practices could result in higher crude protein content but poorer quality protein than organic practices. <br/><br/>There is considerable evidence from controlled experiments that some organic fertilizers result in lower nitrate concentrations in plants than conventional fertilizers. <br/><br/>The ultimate test of the nutritional value of food is its ability to support health, growth, and reproduction over successive generations of animals or humans. Evidence of increased disease resistance, productivity, or fertility of animals feeding on organically grown fodder is anecdotal.",

Generally, all the processors will take care that while packing the organic produce, proper cleaning is done without violating the integrity of the organic nature. Hence, any typical Agri bugs/insects, beetle, etc., are removed. Being Organic, no chemical fumigation or pesticide can be used, and hence these invisible crawlers may survive. Even after a lot of care, with favorable environmental conditions, the eggs may hatch, and rarely possible to spot some bugs in a packet that is still not past its expiry date. So, if you do find these in your packet, don't panic, take it easy, you can clean these out. Still not convinced...? Please just get a replacement.",
